                recruiting agency, having been directly involved in assisting in over 40,000 primary and secondary

            <p>As a first-generation student, you are likely to be challenged with navigating the college process
                without the learning curve that comes from having a college graduate family member to lean on. Parents
                who do not have much first-hand experience or insight on how to maximize your financial aid package or
                the importance of internship opportunities, and networking can be difficult. While figuring out how to
                balance a full course load, a part-time job, and social life are skills you will develop along the way,
                most colleges and quite a few organizations offer scholarships specifically for first-generation
                students to help them thrive in higher education.
