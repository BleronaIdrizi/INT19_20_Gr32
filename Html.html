    <h2><q><b>Products of Education<b></h2>
    <p>Schools are factories. They take in raw materials (children), apply a standard process (curriculum) and turn out a product (children prepared for college). And while many children do become grade A products (by school standards), there are grade B, grade C, grade D, grade F, kids sent to special education, kids sent to trade schools, and drop outs.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Schools are judged by the colleges the products are accepted by. Which feeds into the myth that what we want is a great education so we can get a job that makes good money so we can have a nice house in a nice neighborhood and be a "success".
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		When schools were first designed the idea was to raise up the education level of the general masses. At the time, the "masses"—which included immigrants and children trapped in poverty because life was spent doing what was necessary to stay alive—had a pretty low level of education so the goal wasn't a lofty one. The goal wasn't to get kids into college. The goal was reading and arithmetic and basic knowledge. In the East the goal was better factory workers. In the West, where parents started schools, the goal was basic learning, but the goals were still not lofty.

	<p>Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information.</p>
<p>
Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.


Learning in a library
Education may help and guide individuals from one class to other. Educated individuals and groups can do things like, help less educated people and encourage them to get educated.</p>
