                     laws and administrative regulations.The ministry closely collaborates with the Federation and

                    nine-year compulsory basic comprehensive school (starting at age seven and ending at the age
                     of sixteen, or by receiving the graduation diploma); post-compulsory secondary general

                   <p>Education in North Korea is universal and state-funded schooling by the government. The self-reported national literacy rate for citizens at age of 15 and older is 100 percent (approx.).[1][2] Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to university.

                     In 1988 the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reported that North Korea had 35,000 preprimary, 59,000 primary, 111,000 secondary, 23,000 college and university, and 4,000 other postsecondary teachers.

                   <p>The Norwegian public education system is one of the best in Europe, and the general level of education in Norway is higher than the European average.

                    In Norway, the education system is made up of primary school (Barneskole), lower secondary school (Ungdomsskole) and upper secondary school (Videregående skole).

                    Everyone between the ages of 6 – 16 must attend school in Norway. All public education is free in Norway, and classes are taught in Norwegian (with the exception of foreign language classes, of course).

                    The Norwegian primary and lower secondary education system was reformed in 1997 and a new curriculum was implemented. The different municipalities in Norway are responsible for the running and administration of their public schools.
